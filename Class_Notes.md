Send questions to stakeholder for Team Challenge Project by Wednesday morning.  After you receive a response, work through the process that we covered in class.  You should have a user story, stakeholder analysis, use case analysis, stakeholder needs, mission statement, context diagram(s), FFBD, IDEF0, and requirements.

## Questions for Plastics Transport System Stakeholder(s)

Stakeholder Questions:
1. What kind of stakeholder are you (consumer, activist, politician, customer/government, etc.)?
1. What other stakeholders are we trying to satisfy?
1. What is the target cost: building, operation, maintenance, retirement?

Mission Values:
1. What are your three significant priorities you want to gain from this project (profit, altruism, etc.)?

Interface:
1. Do ICDs exist for vessel, arrival doc, transport median, delivery dock, processing plant?
1. What is the location of arriving vessel?
1. What is the location of recycle facilities?
1. Transportation means between sites: Planes, Trains, Trucks, Ships?
     -  What are the transportation constraints?  Size, Weight? Fuel availability? Transportation availability?
1. Are there hazmat/safety concerns/regulations anywhere in the process?
   - Is PPE needed?
   - Will there be drainage?
   - Inspections?
1. What kind of power constraints are present at each interface (collection site, ports, storage location)?
1. What is the minimum and maximum required cargo capacity? Size & Weight specifications?
1. Is the plastic containerized at the sea-based collection site. 
     - Is plastic compacted or a loose mass, if not containerized? Container Specifications?
     - How will the delivery site accept the plastic?
1. Does the desired system require a self-contained off-loading capability, or does it depend on dock services such as cranes or conveyor belts, suction? At both end-points?
1. What are the expected dock facilities, i.e. type of port? 
     - Location? Operating out of remote port simpler than e.g. Los Angeles or NYC.
     - This informs size, onboard services required...
     - Navigation and traffic avoidance are also complicated in more heavily trafficked locations.
1. Does this system need to support multiple collection sites / ports, (if so, how many?) 

Performance/Environment:
1. Is this a closed loop or open loop?  One-way travel or round trip?
     - What is the maximum round-trip travel distance?
     - Does this take into account adjustments for currents, right-of-way detours, etc?
     - If one-way, where are the pick-up points and drop off points for transportation resources?

1. Is this a batch or continuous process?
1. What is the maximum sea state the system needs to handle?
1. What is the required duty cycle for the system?
1. Are there environmental impact concerns to be taken into account for system operation, such as fuel source?
1. What is the expected transport capacity required per day? (drives speed / size)
1. What is the expected receiving capacity required per day?
1. What is the expected recycling capacity required per day?
1. Does this system need to get transported and stored/maintained in a separate location other than its collection system/port location?
1. What are your maintenance/service requirements? (e.g. built in test requirements to demonstrate operability, etc.)?
