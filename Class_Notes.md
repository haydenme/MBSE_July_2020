- What is the minimum and maximum required cargo capacity?
- Is the plastic containerized at the collection site.
  - Is plastic compacted or a loose mass, if not containerized?
- Does the desired system require a self-contained off-loading capability, or does it depend on dock services such as cranes?
- What are the expected dock facilities, i.e. type of port?
  - Location? Operating out of remote port simpler than e.g. Los Angeles or NYC.
  - This informs size, onboard services required...
- What is the maximum round-trip travel distance? 
  - Does this take into account adjustments for currents, right-of-way detours, etc?
- What is the maximum sea state the system needs to handle?
- What is the required duty cycle for the system?
- Are there environmental impact concerns to be taken into account for system operation, such as fuel source?
