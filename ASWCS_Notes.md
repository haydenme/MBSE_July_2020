### System Boundary

- Sea-based collection system
  - Defined interface
- Recycling center
  - Defined interface (mostly)
- Autonomous movement boundary
  - Outside of ports and shipping lanes
  - Exclusive of "anomalous" events
- Bunker location
  - Assumed well-defined interface
  - Human interaction

### Requirements (Draft)

- The ASWCS shall operate with a maximum downtime of seven days in any four month period.
- The ASWCS shall communicate any anomalous situations to the ground station. (via...?)
- The budget for production, maintenance, and operation of at least one ASWCS transport vessel for a period of three years shall not exceed 56 million dollars. 
- All elements of the ASWCS shall be in service prior to August 1, 2021. (Yeah, that's gonna happen.)
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall have a minimum range of 3500 nautical miles.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall be piloted while in port, as well as between the harbor and any shipping lane.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall maintain a minimum distance of 0.25 nautical miles from all other vessels while operating in autonomous mode.
- Control and communication channels to and from the ASWCS transport vessel shall be encrypted.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall broadcast its position to a ground station at intervals not to exceed (TBR).
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall broadcast changes in status to a ground station, such as underway to docking, docking to docked, transferring waste, etc.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall broadcast changes in cargo weight and volume.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall autonomously dock with sea-based waste collection systems using a documented hardware interface.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall autonomously onload plastic waste from a conveyor belt located at a height of 20 feet above the waterline.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall supply 50 A of 220 VAC power to the sea-based collection system conveyor belt.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall autonomously plug in the connector required to supply 220 VAC power to the sea-based collection system conveyor belt.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall receive plastic waste from the sea-based collection system conveyor belt at a maximum rate of 20 cubic feet per minute.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall have a minimum waste cargo capacity of 6460 cubic feet.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall be capable of traveling a maximum distance of 2400 nautical miles in 10 days (TBR map distance vs "sea route" distance).
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall be capable of docking with the sea-based collection system with ocean swells up to a maximum of six feet.
- The ASWCS transport vessel shall be capable of offloading the waste cargo to a height of 30 feet above waterline.


### Desirements

- The ASWCS shall have living quarters and associated amentities (lavatory, kitchen, etc) for up to five research personnel.
